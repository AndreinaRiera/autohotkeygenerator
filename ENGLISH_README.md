[autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) is a window language that allows you to create routines, keyboard shortcuts, shorteners and automate many tasks on the PC
"The ultimate automation scripting language for Windows."

But... it is a quite complex language, which requires time to learn and take into account many things (such as escaping some special characters in the texts, for example), like any other programming language.


```
#NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
; #Warn ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir% ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

; Write my email quickly

::@g.com::
SendRaw, myFullGmail@gmail.com
return

; Write my personal email quickly

::p@g.com::
SendRaw, myFullPersonalGmail@gmail.com
return
```


Do you understand any of what it says above? This is what a small file looks like in autohotkey. What it does is convert @g.com to myCompleteGmail@gmail.com, and p@g.com to myCompletePersonalGmail@gmail.com

The goal of [autohotkeygenerator](https://autohotkeygenerator.herokuapp.com/) is to make it easy to create and interact with this language.
From an easy and intuitive form you can add the description, the trigger and the action of your routine. Easily adding it to your file. You can include as many routines as you want, and then download the file automatically generated by the app.

Following the steps is very fast to create custom routines to optimize your time on the PC.

## All you can do

With the autohotkey language you can work with variables, loops, dynamic data extracted from the internet or your files, interact directly with web pages in your browser, emails and much more.

You can read the [full documentation here](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm).

In [autohotkeygenerator](https://autohotkeygenerator.herokuapp.com/) I have included just a few of the many possible actions and triggers.

## This is a personal project

The current web app was developed by me, as a demonstration of the general project.
I hope that at some point the idea continues to grow.

If you think it's a good idea, let me know! It would be very useful for me to know.
